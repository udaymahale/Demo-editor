Guides and API reference are located in the [docs](https://github.com/D1SC0tech/draft.js/tree/master/docs) directory and on the [wiki](https://github.com/D1SC0tech/draft.js/wiki) page.

## Getting Started

Include the library at the top of your html file:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="draft.js/dist/draft.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view" style="width: 100%; height: 100%"></div>
</body>
```

Write a new script and include it after your html content:

```javascript
// Create a new draft document and add a group to it
var doc = draft('my_document');
var group = doc.group();

// Add some shapes to the group
var rect = group.rect(200, 150).fill('#18f');
var circle = group.circle(50).fill('#f1c');

// Create a view for the group
var view = group.view(600, 400);

// Use the draft-svg plugin to render an image
var body = document.getElementById('body');
body.appendChild(view.svg());
```
